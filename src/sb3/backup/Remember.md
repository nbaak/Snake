## working Models
The PPOv6 is the best model (so far). It works with flattening the observation. min/max values of the Model are 500. This Model can be used on bigger and smaller fields too. The old min/max from max values of the field are not a good idea.

## Older Models 
The Models PPOv3 and PPOv4 are before flattening the observation and with fixed min/max values of 20!
